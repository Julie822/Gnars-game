# Gnars-game
A replica of T-rex game featured by Gnars.

## Description
Dino Runner, also known as T-Rex Runner, is a popular side-scrolling game that can be played on Google Chrome when there is no internet connection. The game features a small T-Rex dinosaur that runs forward automatically and the player must jump over obstacles, such as cacti and birds, to avoid being hit and increase their score. The longer the player can keep the dinosaur running without hitting an obstacle, the higher their score will be. The game has become quite popular due to its simple yet addictive gameplay and has even inspired its own merchandise and spin-off games.

As a person who is interested in web3, NFTs and @gnars_dao, I decided to make a Gnars version of the game. 
To play the game, please download the zip file and run it on your own environment such as terminal, eclipse or Atom.
For some users, the game may lag a lot when you have bluetooth headphones on due to the audio clips included in the game, so please disconnect it when playing. 

### Development environment: Eclipse
